# Jobs Protocol

## Scope
Legal work loop with payouts, requirements and cooldown-based progression.

## Primary Frontend Entry
- client/lib/screens/jobs_screen.dart

## Change Rules
- Preserve the core player loop and avoid hidden behavior changes.
- Keep Dutch and English copy in sync for any user-visible change.
- Keep layout usable on mobile, tablet and desktop if this module is reachable in the dashboard shell.
- Do not silently remove existing rewards, cooldowns or risk gates without updating help and release notes.

## Check Before Editing
- What is the player trying to achieve in this screen or loop?
- Which timers, locks, rank gates or country rules affect the flow?
- Does this module send notifications, inbox messages, rewards or achievements?
- Does this module depend on assets, videos, icons or generated media?

## Must Preserve
- Clear success and failure feedback for the player.
- Accurate state refresh after an action completes.
- Consistent formatting for money, timers, percentages and labels.
- Responsive usability without pushing critical actions off-screen.
- Job pacing is reward-tier based; higher-paying jobs may not reuse a flat global cooldown if backend pacing has moved to dynamic cooldown seconds.
- Job success/failure semantics in help copy must match the actual backend logic; do not document jobs as guaranteed success if the service can still fail.

## i18n and Messaging
- Any new labels, warnings, helper text or dialogs must exist in both Dutch and English.
- If this module emits notifications, push messages or inbox events, keep the wording aligned across all channels.
- If player behavior changes, update the player help entry for this module.

## QA Checklist
- Open the module on mobile width, tablet width and desktop width.
- Run through the main success path and at least one failure or locked-state path.
- Verify the screen refreshes correctly after actions.
- Verify cooldowns, counters, balances or progress bars remain accurate.
- Verify low-, mid- and high-tier jobs receive the expected cooldown duration based on max payout.
- Verify failed jobs still return coherent player feedback and do not silently deduct money or health.
- Verify no text overflows or clipped buttons appear.

## When To Update This File
Update this protocol when the module gains a new subflow, new dependency, new notification path, major UX change or new QA risk.
